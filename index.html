  <p style="font-size: 22px ;"> We all know that Einstein is a physicist who put more theories on different fields and Albert Einstein was a physicist who developed the general theory of relativity. He is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.
  <br><br>
  In 1921, Einstein won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, since his ideas on relativity were still considered questionable. He wasn't actually given the award until the following year due to a bureaucratic ruling, and during his acceptance speech, he still opted to speak about relativity.
  <br><br>
  In the development of his general theory, Einstein had held onto the belief that the universe was a fixed, static entity, aka a "cosmological constant," though his later theories directly contradicted this idea and asserted that the universe could be in a state of flux. 
  <br><br>
  As a physicist, Einstein had many discoveries, but he is perhaps best known for his theory of relativity and the equation E=MC2, which foreshadowed the development of atomic power and the atomic bomb.
