	<p style="font-size: 22px ; color: black ">  special relativity and general relativity
	.Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. 
	General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. 
	It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy. <br> <br> Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime.
	It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" (for the contributions of many other physicists see History of special relativity). 
	Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in classical mechanics:

    The laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference relative to one another (principle of relativity).
    The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the light source.
    The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics. For instance, postulate 2 explains the results of the Michelson–Morley experiment. Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences.<br><br> Some of these are:
	
    Relativity of simultaneity: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion.
    Time dilation: Moving clocks are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's "stationary" clock.
    Length contraction: Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.
    Maximum speed is finite: No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum.
    The effect of Gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously.
    Mass–energy equivalence: E = mc2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.
    Relativistic mass, idea used by some researchers.</p>

	<h3 style="color:maroon ; font-size:25px ;"><b><ins>Theory of Photoelectric effect</ins></b></h3>
	<p style="font-size: 22px ; color: black "> The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where electrons are emitted from the metal surface when the light of sufficient frequency is incident upon. The concept of the photoelectric effect was first documented in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz and later by Lenard in 1902. But both the observations of the photoelectric effect could not be explained by Maxwell’s electromagnetic wave theory of light. Hertz (who had proved the wave theory) himself did not pursue the matter as he felt sure that it could be explained by the wave theory. However, the concept failed in the following accounts:
    <br> <br>
	1- According to the wave theory, energy is uniformly distributed across the wavefront and is dependent only on the intensity of the beam. This implies that the kinetic energy of electrons increases with light intensity. However, the kinetic energy was independent of light intensity.
    <br> <br>
	2- Wave theory says that light of any frequency should be capable of ejecting electrons. But electron emission occurred only for frequencies larger than a threshold frequency (ν0).
    <br> <br>
	3- Since energy is dependent on intensity according to wave theory, the low-intensity light should emit electrons after some time so that the electrons can acquire sufficient energy to get emitted. However, electron emission was spontaneous no matter how small the intensity of light.
    <br> <br>
	</p>
	<h4 style="font-size: 26px ; color: black "><ins>Einstein’s Explanation of Photoelectric Effect</ins></h4>
	<p style="font-size: 22px ; color: black "> Einstein resolved this problem using Planck’s revolutionary idea that light was a particle. The energy carried by each particle of light (called quanta or photon) is dependent on the light’s frequency (ν) as shown:
    <br>             <b>E=hv</b>   <br>
	Where h = Planck’s constant = 6.6261 × 10<sup>-34</sup> Js.<br>
	Since light is bundled up into photons, Einstein theorized that when a photon falls on the surface of a metal, the entire photon’s energy is transferred to the electron.

    A part of this energy is used to remove the electron from the metal atom’s grasp and the rest is given to the ejected electron as kinetic energy. Electrons emitted from underneath the metal surface lose some kinetic energy during the collision. But the surface electrons carry all the kinetic energy imparted by the photon and have the maximum kinetic energy.
    <br>
    We can write this mathematically as:
    <br>
    Energy of photon = energy required to eject an electron (work function) + Maximum kinetic energy of the electron
    <br>
    <b>E = W + KE</b>
    <br>
    <b>hv = W + KE</b>
    <br>
    <b>KE = hv – w</b>
    <br>
    At the threshold frequency, ν<sub>o</sub> electrons are just ejected and do not have any kinetic energy. Below this frequency, there is no electron emission. Thus, the energy of a photon with this frequency must be the work function of the metal.
    <br>
    <b>w = hv<Sub>0</Sub></b>
    <br>
    Thus, Maximum kinetic energy equation becomes:
    <br>
    <b>KE = 1/2mv<Sup>2</Sup><Sub>max</Sub>=hv–hv<Sub>0</Sub></b>
    <br>
    <b>1/2mv<Sup>2</Sup><Sub>max</Sub>=h(v−v<Sub>0</Sub>)</b> 
    <br>
    V<sub>max</sub> is the maximum kinetic energy of the electron. It is calculated experimentally using the stopping potential. Please read our article on Lenard’s observations to understand this part.
    <br>
    Stopping potential = e<Sub>v0</Sub> = 1/2mv<Sup>2</Sup><Sub>max</Sub>
    <br>
    Thus, Einstein explained the Photoelectric effect by using the particle nature of light.
